Message Bundling and Chunking
=============================

OpenSRF now supports message chunking, i.e., breaking up large OpenSRF
messages across multiple XMPP envelopes. This is implemented with a
new OpenSRF message type.

C, Perl, and Javascript libraries are taught how to reconstruct chunked
messages. The default chunking threshold is 50Kb, just a bit below the
default ejabberd max stanza size of 64Kb.

What was previously called chunking is now referred to as bundling:
packing multiple OpenSRF messages together in a single XMPP envelope,
as long as we believe more messages will be sent in the future and we
are below some threshold of combined message size.  The default for
that threshold is 25Kb.

With this change, it is no longer necessary to change the `max_stanza_size`
setting for ejabberd when installing OpenSRF.
